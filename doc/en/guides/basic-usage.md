## üìù Best Practices for Beginners

### 1. Start with Paper Trading

- 3% maximum daily loss
- 1% trailing stop

### 3. Focus on Higher Timeframes

- Higher timeframes are generally more reliable

### 4. Diversify Your Analysis

- Don't rely on a single signal
- Use dual timeframe analysis
- Check multiple indicators
- Consider market regime

### 5. Monitor Performance

- Keep track of your trades
- Use the bot's performance tracking
- Adjust strategies based on results

## üîç Understanding Market Conditions

### Trending Markets

In trending markets (detected by `b!market_regime`):
- Follow the trend direction
- Use momentum indicators (MACD)
- Set wider stop losses

### Ranging Markets

In sideways markets:
- Use mean reversion strategies
- Look for oversold/overbought conditions
- Use tighter profit targets

### Volatile Markets

In high volatility:
- Reduce position sizes
- Use wider stops
- Consider shorter timeframes

## üö® Common Beginner Mistakes

### 1. Ignoring Risk Management
- **Problem**: Trading without stop losses
- **Solution**: Always set stop losses and position sizes

### 2. Overtrading
- **Problem**: Taking every signal
- **Solution**: Be selective, focus on high-confidence signals

### 3. FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)
- **Problem**: Chasing pumps and entering late
- **Solution**: Wait for proper entry points

### 4. Emotional Trading
- **Problem**: Letting emotions drive decisions
- **Solution**: Stick to the bot's signals and risk rules

### 5. Insufficient Testing
- **Problem**: Going live without proper testing
- **Solution**: Extensive paper trading and backtesting
