## Current Status
**CURRENT: Help Command Implementation Complete**
The bot now features a comprehensive help command that matches the style of the Jockie Music bot reference provided by the user. The help system organizes all available commands into logical categories (Meta, Getting Started, Trading, Strategies, Indicators, Signals, Optimization) across two pages for easy navigation. The Discord.py conflict has been resolved by properly disabling the default help command, and the bot now starts successfully.

**Previous Status:**
The bot is capable of generating and displaying trading signals in professional format. It connects to Binance to get real-time market data and automatically calculates entry, take profit, and stop loss levels based on current market volatility.

Users can create signals either manually (specifying all parameters) or automatically (letting the bot calculate appropriate levels). The bot also supports generating signals for multiple coins at once with the `market_signals` command.

Recent improvements included a comprehensive system to prevent duplicate signals, with multi-layered detection including command locking, signal flagging, and timestamp-based deduplication. The duplicate signal issue has been fixed by improving error handling, adding better signal tracking, and enhancing the signal storage mechanism with more robust duplicate detection logic (60-second window). The bot uses consistent "Reina" attribution for all generated signals.

Major enhancements have been implemented based on the Discord Trade Bot Guide, including multi-exchange support via CCXT, professional risk management with position sizing, enhanced technical indicators using pandas-ta, dual timeframe confirmation strategies, and advanced order placement with take-profit and stop-loss in one command. The bot now follows industry best practices for trading bot development with proper risk controls and technical analysis.

The basic functionality is complete, with several advanced features implemented. The bot can be run in demo mode without Binance API credentials, making it easy to test.
