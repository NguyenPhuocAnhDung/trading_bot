# Progress: Discord Trading Signal Bot

## What Works
- ✅ Basic Discord bot setup with command handling
- ✅ Connection to Binance API for cryptocurrency data
- ✅ Trading signal formatting using Discord embeds
- ✅ SC01-style signal generation with proper formatting
- ✅ Support for all required signal parameters (entry, TP, SL, ratio, status)
- ✅ Command-based signal creation
- ✅ Basic error handling and logging
- ✅ Signal storage mechanism in the TradingBot class
- ✅ Demo mode for running without Binance API credentials
- ✅ Real-time signal generation based on actual market data
- ✅ Automatic calculation of TP/SL based on volatility (ATR)
- ✅ Multiple commands for different signal generation needs
- ✅ Support for generating signals for multiple coins at once
- ✅ Duplicate signal prevention system
- ✅ Command cooldowns to prevent accidental multiple executions
- ✅ Improved status message handling for better UX
- ✅ Consistent author attribution on all signals

## What's Left to Build
- ⬜ Multiple signal templates/styles beyond SC01
- ⬜ Scheduled signal broadcasting
- ⬜ Persistent signal history and retrieval system (database)
- ⬜ Image/chart attachments for signals
- ⬜ User reaction tracking for signals
- ⬜ Multilingual support for signal labels
- ⬜ Enhanced signal analytics
- ⬜ User permissions and role-based access
- ⬜ Signal performance tracking and statistics
- ⬜ Multi-timeframe analysis for signal generation

## Current Status
The bot is now capable of generating and displaying trading signals in the format shown in the example. It can connect to Binance to get real-time market data and automatically calculate entry, take profit, and stop loss levels based on current market volatility.

Users can create signals either manually (specifying all parameters) or automatically (letting the bot calculate appropriate levels). The bot also supports generating signals for multiple coins at once with the `market_signals` command.

Recent improvements include a system to prevent duplicate signals from being created and cooldown timers on commands to prevent accidental multiple executions. The bot now uses consistent "Reina" attribution for all generated signals.

The basic functionality is complete, with several advanced features implemented. The bot can be run in demo mode without Binance API credentials, making it easy to test.

## Known Issues
- No persistent storage for signals (currently held in memory only)
- Limited to a single signal format (SC01 style)
- No automatic signal generation based on complex market conditions/patterns
- No way to edit or delete signals after creation
- No user authentication for signal creation (anyone can create signals)
- No historical performance tracking for signals

## Next Milestones
1. **Signal Persistence**: Implement database storage for signals
2. **Signal Templates**: Add support for multiple signal formats/styles
3. **Scheduled Signals**: Create a scheduler for automatic signal broadcasting
4. **Signal Management**: Add commands to edit, delete, and manage signals
5. **User Authentication**: Implement role-based permissions for signal creation
6. **Performance Tracking**: Add signal performance monitoring and statistics
