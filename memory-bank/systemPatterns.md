### 2. Command Handler (`src/bot/commands/`)
- Processes user commands with "b!" prefix
- Routes requests to appropriate modules
- Handles command arguments and validation
- Returns responses to users with professional formatting
- Implements command cooldowns to prevent duplicates
- Supports advanced commands for technical analysis

### 3. Configuration System (`src/config/`)
- **Revolutionary YAML + Environment Variable Integration**

- Retrieves real-time market data
- Processes trading operations with live price data
- Manages trading strategy application
- Stores and manages signal data
- Implements duplicate detection logic with 60-second windows

### 5. Strategy Engine (`src/trading/strategies/`)
- Defines trading strategy interfaces
- Implements specific strategies (MACD+RSI, Moving Average, etc.)
- Analyzes market data with 10+ technical indicators
- Generates trading signals with SC01/SC02 formatting
- Supports multi-timeframe analysis

### 6. Risk Management (`src/trading/risk_management.py`)
- Dynamic position sizing based on account balance
- ATR-based stop-loss and take-profit calculations
- Configurable risk parameters (per trade, daily limits)
- Kelly Criterion inspired position sizing
- Risk/reward ratio optimization

### 7. Signal Formatter (`src/trading/signal_formatter.py`)
- Formats trading signals into standardized structure
- Creates visual representations of signals with Discord embeds
- Implements the SC01/SC02 signal formats
- Professional formatting with color coding and emojis

### 8. Optimization System (`src/trading/optimization/`)
- Parameter optimization using genetic algorithms
- Grid search optimization capabilities
- Market condition analysis for adaptive strategies
- Performance tracking and analytics
- Backtesting framework integration

## Design Patterns

### Factory Pattern
- Used in `get_strategy()` to instantiate different strategy types
- Allows extensibility for new strategies
- Implemented in strategy engine for clean abstraction

### Command Pattern
- Implemented through Discord's command system
- Each command is encapsulated as a separate function
- Allows for easy addition of new commands
- Enhanced with cooldown decorators for rate limiting

### Strategy Pattern
- Used for different trading strategies
- Common interface through `TradingStrategy` base class
- Specialized implementations like `DualMACD_RSI`, `MovingAverageCrossover`

### Repository Pattern
- Used for storing and retrieving signals
- Encapsulates signal storage logic
- Implements duplicate checking for data integrity
- Database abstraction layer ready for production

### Decorator Pattern
- Used with command cooldowns
- Adds rate-limiting behavior to commands without modifying their core logic
- Professional error handling and user feedback

### Configuration Pattern
- YAML + environment variable hybrid approach
- Dataclass mapping for type safety
- Environment overrides for production deployment
- Smart caching for optimal performance

## Data Flow

1. **Command Input**: User enters command with "b!" prefix in Discord
2. **Cooldown Check**: Command is checked against cooldown limits
3. **Command Processing**: Bot parses command and arguments
4. **Configuration Loading**: System loads configuration with environment overrides
5. **Business Logic**: Command handler invokes appropriate modules
6. **Data Retrieval/Processing**: Trading module gets/processes live market data
7. **Strategy Application**: Technical analysis and signal generation
8. **Risk Management**: Position sizing and risk calculations
9. **Duplicate Check**: System verifies the signal doesn't already exist
10. **Response Formatting**: Format results as professional Discord embeds
11. **Response Output**: Send formatted response back to Discord

## Key Technical Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Discord.py Framework**: Chosen for its robust handling of Discord API
2. **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns for maintainability
3. **Professional Configuration**: YAML + environment variables for flexibility
4. **Multi-Exchange Support**: CCXT integration for broad market access
5. **Real-time Data**: Live market data integration for accurate signals

### User Experience Decisions
1. **Embed-based Output**: Used for visually appealing, structured messages
2. **Command Prefix "b!"**: Binance-inspired prefix for brand consistency
3. **Professional Formatting**: SC01/SC02 signal formats for industry standard
4. **Comprehensive Help**: 2-page categorized command reference
5. **Error Handling**: User-friendly messages with helpful guidance

### Technical Implementation Decisions
1. **Strategy Abstraction**: Base class for easily adding new strategies
2. **Environment Variable Configuration**: For secure credential management
3. **Exception Handling**: Comprehensive error handling throughout the application
4. **Command Cooldowns**: Rate limiting to prevent accidental duplicate executions
5. **Status Message Management**: Using message editing to provide feedback
6. **Advanced Technical Analysis**: 10+ indicators with pandas-ta integration
7. **Genetic Algorithm Optimization**: Parameter tuning for strategy improvement

### Production Decisions
1. **Multiple Deployment Options**: VPS, Docker, Heroku, Cloud platforms
2. **Database Abstraction**: SQLite ready, upgradable to PostgreSQL
3. **Comprehensive Logging**: Structured output for production monitoring
4. **Security Best Practices**: API key encryption and environment protection
5. **Systemd Integration**: Production service management for VPS deployment
